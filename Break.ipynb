    "In Python, the break statement is a control statement used to exit a loop prematurely. It allows you to terminate the current loop and resume execution of the program after the loop. Here's a simple explanation of how the break statement works:\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you have a loop (e.g., for or while) that is designed to run a set of instructions repeatedly until a certain condition is met. The break statement is used to interrupt the loop and stop its execution when a specific condition is satisfied. Once the break statement is encountered, the loop immediately exits, and the program continues with the code outside of the loop."
